title: "About me"

## Background:

I am a medical doctor from Afghanistan with three years of experience in the Interventional Cardiology Department. During this time, I worked extensively with a team to deploy stents for occluded heart vessels and implant permanent and temporary pacemakers in patients.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I participated in contact tracing and data gathering efforts. This experience sparked my interest in public health and motivated me to pursue a Master of Public Health (MPH) with a focus on Biostatistics. I am now a second-year MPH student dedicated to learning how to analyze health data effectively and contribute to meaningful research.

## Research Interests:

My primary research interest lies in analyzing health-related data, particularly in the field of cancer research. I am passionate about leveraging statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights in healthcare and contribute to advancing medical knowledge.

## Technical Skills:

I have a course in R so I have a basic experience with it. For my final project in that course, I analyzed a dataset, which gave me initial exposure to data analysis. However, I am eager to learn how to conduct analyses in a more structured and systematic manner.

## Goals:

My primary goal for this course is to understand the fundamentals of what makes a good data analysis. I hope to implement that knowledge to develop skills that are both practical and impactful in real-world applications.

## Fun Fact:

I can speak five languages and have a passion for traveling. So far, Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to visit places across three continents. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies, which help me relax and recharge.
