## Background:

I'm a passionate medical doctor from Afghanistan with a background in Interventional Cardiology. With over three years of hands-on experience, I've worked closely with a skilled team to deploy stents for heart vessel blockages and implant both permanent and temporary pacemakers to improve patient care.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took part in critical contact tracing and data collection efforts, which sparked my interest in public health. This led me to pursue a Master of Public Health (MPH), specializing in Biostatistics. As I transition into the field of health data analysis, I am confident that my combined background in medicine and my newly acquired biostatistics skills empower me to make an even greater impact. I can now extend my ability to improve healthcare, not only through direct patient care but also by analyzing and driving data-informed decisions that can benefit my community on a larger scale.

Currently a second-year MPH student, I am dedicated to mastering data analysis to contribute to impactful research, evidence-based healthcare decision-making, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes. Feel free to explore my projects and contributions, where I aim to blend my medical expertise with data-driven insights to drive positive change in healthcare!

## Research Interests:

My primary research focus is on analyzing health-related data that profoundly affects quality of life, with a particular interest in cancer research and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Having worked as a physician, I am also deeply invested in researching coronary artery diseases, an area where I’ve gained firsthand experience in patient care. I am passionate about using statistical methods to extract valuable insights from healthcare data, aiming to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Through my work, I hope to uncover patterns and solutions that can drive progress in these critical areas of healthcare.

## **Technical Skills:**

I have developed a solid foundation in R and SAS, having actively engaged with both tools as part of my Master of Public Health (MPH) program. Through hands-on coursework and projects, I have gained experience in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. For example, in my coursework, I analyzed a dataset using R, which introduced me to essential techniques in data exploration and analysis.

While I am continuously honing my skills, I approach these tools with a mindset of constant learning. I believe that mastering R and SAS is a journey, and I am committed to further expanding my expertise as I explore more advanced methods in statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and Biostatistics. With every project, I strive to apply my growing knowledge to real-world challenges, always seeking opportunities to learn and contribute to evidence-based decision-making in healthcare.

I look forward to continually evolving my technical capabilities to make a greater impact in public health and data-driven research.

## Goals:

My primary goal for this course is to gain a deep understanding of the key principles and methodologies that underpin effective data analysis. I aim to apply this foundational knowledge to develop practical, results-driven skills that can be directly applied to real-world challenges. By mastering these techniques, I hope to not only enhance my analytical abilities but also make meaningful contributions to data-driven decision-making in professional settings.

## Fun Fact:

I’m a language enthusiast, fluent in five languages, which has not only helped me connect with people from different cultures but also fueled my passion for traveling. To date, I’ve been fortunate enough to explore places across three continents, and I’m always excited for my next adventure. When I’m not traveling or learning new languages, you’ll probably find me unwinding with video games or getting lost in a good movie, which are my favorite ways to relax and recharge.
